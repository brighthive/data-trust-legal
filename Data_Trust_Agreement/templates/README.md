## Data Trust Templates

Templates are files that contain pre-filled values for data trust agreements. 
 
Templates can be either markdown files (.md) for legal language templates, or python files (.py) for data trust model templates that can be use by docassemble/mako for authoring data trust agreements.

Templates are organized by template folders.

Example
