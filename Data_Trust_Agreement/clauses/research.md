**5. Academic Research as a Use Case or Approved Use.**


A. The Data Trust may be used to research as an Approved Use. The Trustee shall make available a secure Research Hub ("Research Hub") for access by approved researchers. The Governance Board shall put in place a process for deciding Third Party Researcher access to Trust-managed Data Resources through the Research Hub. This Research Hub may be managed by the Trustee or its Affiliate(s).

B. The Governance Board reviews and approves Third Party Researchers and their respective proposals to use Trust-managed Data Resources. The Governance Board may consult with subject matter experts, including researchers, representatives of relevant interest groups, and/or other technical experts, to advise their decision on a proposal.

C. A Third Party Researcher may submit a proposal for the use of Trust-managed Data Resources. A proposal that requires access to any data classified as sensitive or personally identifiable data must be reviewed and approved by the Governance Board before the Trustee permits access to the data through the Research Hub.

D. A proposal from a Third Party Researcher that uses only Unrestricted Data may be reviewed and approved by only the Trustee using an expedited review process defined by the Governance Board and does not require the review or approval of the Governance Board. Upon its approval of a proposal using only Unrestricted Data, the Trustee may permit the Third Party Researcher access to the Unrestricted data through the Research Hub.

E. All Third Party Researchers will be required to execute a separate data use agreement with the Trustee on behalf of the Governance Board that stipulates, as appropriate, the permissions, use, analyses approved, timeline, ethical guidelines, reporting of accidental misuse, required training, and approved publications.

F. A Third Party Researcher that is affiliated with an organization, including a university, with an Institutional Review Board (IRB), or an equivalent, shall be required to get IRB approval prior to accessing any data in the data trust.

G. The Trustee will record and make publicly available all approved Third Party Researchers and proposals.

H. Data Trust Members retain the right to opt out of the use of their data in any research project at any time.

**I. Publication of Research**

1. A Third Party Researcher may publish the results of research as stipulated in their individual data use agreement with the Trustee, provided such publication does not disclose Confidential Information, Member-contributed Data Resources or Trust-managed Data Resources classified as sensitive or personally identifiable information.

2. Data that has been aggregated by the Third Party Researcher may be published in accordance with other Unrestricted Data as determined by the Governance Board. However, prior to any such publication, Member and all other Data Trust Members which contribute data used in the creation of aggregate data shall be able review the aggregated data to verify no Restricted Data or Highly Restricted data is revealed.

3. A Third Party Researcher shall agree that, prior to submission of a manuscript describing any results for publication, they will share the manuscript with the Trustee and the Trustee shall forward to all Data Trust Members a copy of the manuscript to be submitted.

4. Members shall have thirty (30) days to determine whether a patent application or other intellectual property protection should be sought prior to the Third Party Researcher publishing their results in order to protect the Member’s proprietary interests in any product or invention developed in connection with the Third Party Researcher’s approved research proposal.

4. The Trustee agrees to withhold approving publication for an additional sixty (60) business days, if required, to allow Members to obtain patent protection. Upon the expiration of the sixty (60) business days, the Trustee shall allow the Third Party Researcher to submit the manuscript and publish results in any manner consistent with academic standards.
