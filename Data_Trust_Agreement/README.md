# BrightHive Data Trust Legal Templates

Data Trusts are vehicles for multiple organizations to securely, responsibly, and ethically combine their data for one or more shared purposes.  

This repository contains versioned clauses and templates the BrightHive and its Trusted Partner Network use to develop and maintaining data trusts networks of organizations that engage with us.

The BrightHive Data Trust Agreement (DTA) makes use of an underlying data model called a *trust graph* to author the legal documents.
