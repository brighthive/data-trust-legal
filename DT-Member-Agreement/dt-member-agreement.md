Trustee agrees to keep all Tier 1 and Tier 2 Member-contributed Data Resources confidential and only disclose them to its employees and Affiliates who need access in order to meet Trustee’s obligations and requirements for Member, other Data Trust Members, and the Data Trust for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement. Further, Trustee represents and certifies that no Data Trust Member or Third Party shall have access to Member's Tier 1 or Tier 2 data in its raw form without express written or electronic approval by Member.

D. Trustee will ensure that no Tier 1 or Tier 2 data in its raw form will be included in any published data. During the implementation of Projects and Allowable Uses, Trustee, Members, or approved Third Party Researchers, may develop aggregate data that qualifies for Tier 0 classification as defined by the privacy and anonymization criteria adopted by the Governance Board. Such aggregate data may be published in accordance with all other Tier 0 data, as determined by the Governance Board. However, prior to any such release, Member and all other Data Trust Members which own data used in the creation of aggregate data shall be able to review the aggregate data to verify no Tier 1 or Tier 2 data is revealed.

## 4. Data Trust Governance Structure.

A. Designated representative(s) of Member, along with all other Data Trust Members’ designated representatives collectively, form the Data Trust Governance Board ("Governance Board"). The Governance Board is responsible for approving Trust-managed data resource access and use, developing necessary policies and privacy standards for Trust-managed data resources, and selecting and overseeing the Trustee in its duties in accordance with this Agreement.

B. The Governance Board is chaired by the Trustee’s Governance Board representative. The Governance Board chair is responsible for scheduling Governance Board meetings, maintaining the list of Governance Board members, maintaining record of Governance Board vote tallies and decisions, and other duties as needed.

C. Each Data Trust Member, including the Trustee, has one equal vote on the Governance Board regardless of its number of Governance Board representatives. Any Governance Board representative representing more than one Data Trust Member must vote or abstain once on behalf of each Data Trust Member they are representing.

D. An electronic registry of all Governance Board representatives shall be maintained by the Governance Board chair and updated at the request of Member. Additionally, an electronic registry of all Governance Board decisions and vote tallies, including abstentions, will be maintained by the Governance Board chair on behalf of the Data Trust.

E. Governance Board Composition, Responsibilities, and Voting
  a. The primary responsibility of the Governance Board is to monitor the creation and sharing of data trust-managed resources, review and approve new data trust-managed resources, and identify and approve new data trust users and expansions. The Governance Board is also responsible for reviewing the performance of the Trustee, and voting to replace Trustee when deemed appropriate by the Governance Board.
  b. Governance Board meetings shall be held at a minimum of once a quarter, or more frequently at the request of any Governance Board representative.
  c. Governance Board meetings will be organized and managed by the Governance Board chair.
  d. Governance Board meetings are open to all Governance Board representatives to discuss the status of the Data Trust, review current approved project(s), renew current uses and projects up for renewal, approve newly proposed projects and uses, review, modify, and add Ethical Commitments, review Trustee's performance, renew or change Trustee based on performance of duties, approve Trust management budgets, and conduct any other business the Governance Board deems necessary for Data Trust governance. Additionally, Governance Board representatives may invite data stewards or subject matter experts to attend Governance Board meetings in order to provide substantive, technical, and/or contextual expertise for the purposes of discussion.
  e. The Governance Board may elect to hold meetings and votes in-person, remotely or electronically (via email or some other electronic messaging platform).
  f. Governance Board decisions about projects and approved uses, whether new or existing, must be approved unanimously by all Governance Board representatives. A unanimous vote may be obtained even if one or more Governance Board representatives abstain from voting. Members with Data Governance representatives who abstain from a vote may elect to have their data excluded from the approved project or new approved use. Trustee will be responsible for ensuring that any project or use approved unanimously by a voting subset of Members will not include data from any abstaining Member which elects to exclude their data.
  g. Governance Board decisions about adopting or updating the Trust's ethical principles and guidelines shall require a unanimous vote. A unanimous vote may be obtained even if one or more Governance Board representatives abstains from voting.
  h. The Governance Board will periodically review the performance of the Trustee. Through a simple majority vote, the Governance Board may choose to change the Trustee at any time based on poor performance or violation of one or more of the terms of the Agreement. Replacing the Trustee does not void this Agreement. In the event that a new Trustee is selected, the new Trustee will assume the Trustee duties within 30 days and the current Trustee will continue to carry out its duties during that time. This same process will govern instances when a trustee chooses to leave their role as Trustee. Once selected, all rights, obligations, and responsibilities of the Trustee under the Agreement shall transfer to new Trustee, the electronic registry of this Agreement shall be updated to reflect the current Trustee. Abstentions do not count either as a vote for or against and are not included in the tally, but are noted in the record by the Governance Board chair.
  i. Governance Board members must be notified of an upcoming vote at least 1 week prior to the scheduled vote. Governance Board members may vote either in-person or electronically within 24 hours of the scheduled vote. Any Governance Board representative who does not provide a vote to the chair either in-person or electronically within 24 hours of a scheduled vote shall be considered abstaining. Governance Board representatives  may temporarily delegate their voting rights to any other individual or Governance Board representative by informing chair 24 hours in advance of any vote that they are delegating their voting rights and to whom the voting rights are to be delegated.

## 5. Academic Research as a Project or Approved Use.

A. The Data Trust may, in this Agreement or through a future vote of the Governance Board, approve Academic research as an Approved Use of the Trust-managed Data Resources. If approved, the Trustee shall make available a secure Data Trust Research Hub ("Research Hub") for access by approved researchers and put in place a process for certifying academic researchers for access to Trust-managed Data Resources through the Research Hub.

1. Consider collecting informed and purposeful consent of data subjects for all projects, regardless of legal requirements, and discard resulting data when that consent expires.
2. Make best effort to guarantee the security of data, subjects, and algorithms to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure of sensitive information, policy violations, tampering, or harm to  data subjects.
3. Make best effort to protect anonymous data subjects, and any associated data, against any attempts to reverse-engineer, de-anonymize, or otherwise expose confidential information.
    *   This includes all intermediate results, working with individuals or companies to help them maintain the anonymity of all data and parties involved, and supporting the rights to explanation, recourse, and rectification for any data subjects impacted by data work.
4. Practice responsible transparency as the default where possible, throughout the entire data lifecycle.
    *   This includes providing enough context and documentation to enable other trained practitioners to understand and evaluate the use of data.
5. Foster diversity and openness by making efforts to ensure inclusion of participants from a variety of communities and socioeconomic backgrounds and with a broad representation of viewpoints.
    *   This can be achieved by: being conscious of, and owning the results of actions, regardless of intent; promoting the voices of marginalized groups; acknowledging and self-checking privilege; accepting checks of privilege by others in good faith, and using privilege to advocate for equity.
    *   The data community will not remain silent when witnessing others behaving in a manner that is not accessible, open, welcoming and inclusive.
6. Acknowledge and mitigate unfair bias throughout all aspects of data work.
    *   This includes but is not limited to providing details and methodologies around data collection, processing and storage; and actively working to identify and disclose bias in algorithms, training data, and test data.
7. Make datasets with clearly established provenance the expected norm, rather than the exception.
    *   As a data collector, be responsible for recording provenance; as a data publisher, be responsible for propagating provenance; as a data scientist, be responsible for reviewing, considering, and declaring what is known about data provenance.
    *   Provenance is a living part of data work and can evolve with the project and all reasonable efforts should be made to understand and pass on provenance work.
8. Respect the needs of all stakeholders as they relate to privacy and data ownership.
9. Take great care to communicate clearly, responsibly and accessibly.
    *   This includes: acknowledging and disclosing caveats and limitations to the process and outputs; considering and providing clear opportunities for feedback from all stakeholders; considering and discussing whether something should be done (not just if it can be done); and clearly identifying and communicating who may be impacted, and how they are impacted, in order to minimize any potential harm from data work.
10. Ensure that all data practitioners take responsibility for exercising ethical imagination in their work, including considering the implication of what came before and what may come after, and actively working to increase benefit and prevent harm to others.
