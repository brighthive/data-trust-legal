g. Trustee will ensure that no Tier 1 or Tier 2 Data in its raw form will be included in any published data. Trustee, Members, or Third Party Researchers may develop Aggregate Data that meets approved privacy and anonymization criteria for Aggregate data to be classified as Tier 0 Data by the Governance Board and approved for publication for access by the public or approved Users. However, prior to any such release, Member and all other Members of data used in the creation of Aggregate Data for the Project and Approved Use shall be able to review the Aggregate Data to verify no Tier 1 or Tier 2 Data is included.



### Governance Board Composition, Responsibilities, and Voting


h. There will be Governance Board meetings at a minimum of once a quarter (but may be more frequent if the Governance Board chooses). Governance Board meetings will be organized and managed by the Trustee. Governance Board meetings are open to all Data Trust Members to discuss the status of the Trust, review current approved project, renew current uses and projects up for renewal, approve newly proposed Projects and Uses, review, modify, and add Ethical Commitments, review Trustee's performance, renew or change Trustee based on performance of duties, approve Trust management budgets, and conduct any other business the Governance Board deems necessary for Trust governance. The Governance Board may elect to hold discussion and votes remotely or electronically and not in person. 


i. The primary responsibility of the Governance Board is to review and approve current and new Projects and Approved Uses for Member Contributed Data and Trust Data Resources. Governance Board decisions about Projects and Approved Uses, whether new or existing, must be approved unanimously by all Member representatives on the Governance Board. Members may abstain from any vote and still have the Project or Approved Use pass by unanimously by voting Members. Members abstaining may also elect to have their data excluded from the Project or Approved Use. Trustee will be responsible for ensuring that any Project or Use approved unanimously by a voting subset of all Trust Members will only use data from the voting members and not include data from any abstaining Member.


j. Governance Board decisions about adopting or updating the Trust's ethical principles and guidelines, shall require a unanimous vote. Abstentions do not count either as a vote for or against and are not included in the tally, but are noted in the record by the Trustee.


k. The Governance Board will periodically review the performance of the Trustee and may vote to change the Trustee at any time based on poor performance or violation of one or more of the terms of the Agreement through a simple majority of the Governance Board. Replacing the Trustee does not void the Agreement. In the event that a new Trustee is selected by majority vote of the Governance Board, Trustee will continue to do its duties under the agreement until a new Trustee is selected by a simple majority vote of the Governance Board. Once selected, all rights, obligations, and responsibilities of the Trustee under the Agreement shall transfer to new Trustee, the electronic registry of this Agreement shall be updated to reflect the current Trustee. Abstentions do not count either as a vote for or against and are not included in the tally, but are noted in the record by the Trustee.


l. Any Member without a representative or delegate present at a meeting or voting within 24 hours of an electronic vote shall be considered abstaining for all votes during the meeting. Members may temporarily assign a delegate for any Governance Board Meeting by informing Trustee 24 hours in advance of any vote.


### Academic Research as a Project or Approved Use


m. The Trust may in this Agreement or through a future vote of the Governance Board, approve Academic research as an Approved Use of the Trust-managed Data Resources. If approved, the Trustee shall make available a secure Data Trust Research Hub for access by approved Researchers and put in place a process for certifying academic researchers for access to Trust-managed Data Resources through the Research Hub. This Research Hub may be managed directly by the Trustee, or done through one or more Affiliates contracted by the Trustee.


n. Individual researchers or research institutions ("Third Party Researcher") proposing to contribute to one or more Projects and Approved Uses that requires access to one or more Member's Tier 1 or Tier 2 Contributed Data or Trust-managed Data Resource derived from Member Contributed Data must be approved in writing or by electronic approval process by Trustee responsible for managing the Data Trust Research Hub. Such Third Party Researcher will be required to execute an agreement whereby they are bound by the same terms and conditions as those stipulated herein. Further, Trustee or Affiliates will provide prompt written or electronic notice via Member's electronic portal to all relevant Members that their Tier 1 or Tier 2 Data is being used by such Third Party Researcher and Member may notify Trustee at any time to revoke such Third Party Researcher's access to the Tier 1 or Tier 2 Data. Prior to being approved for access to the research data hub, researchers will need to sign a Data Trust researcher agreement and complete a required training course which covers use of the data portal, allowable use of private research hub data, researcher obligations to Members, ethical guidelines, reporting of accidental misuse, and research review prior to publication. This training will be detailed on the Data Trust Research Hub's website and will be updated from time to time. Proof of training completion will be required prior to the issuing of researcher credentials. Third Party Researcher may also be required to complete relevant IRB approval prior to approval for access and use of Trust data for research. Categories of allowable uses of Tier 1 and Tier 2 data by third party researchers along with their associated responsibilities and restrictions will be reviewed and approved or rejected periodically by the Data Trust Governance Board, or by a separately established Research Hub Review Committee. The Research Hub Review Committee will be comprised of experienced researchers or other technical experts from the Trustee and a subset of Data Trust Member organizations, and may include select invited representatives from relevant communities or local interest groups. Proposals for new categories of research uses will be reviewed at least quarterly and approved through an in-person or online approval process through a consensus mechanism set by the Research Hub Review Committee. All approved researchers and proposals will be registered electronically and made known and available at all times to all Members and the public. Data Trust Members will retain the right to opt out of the use of their data in any particular research project at any time. Individuals whose records are in the data trust will also retain the right to opt out of the use of their data for any or all research projects at anyt ime and Trustee must make available a simple and accessible way for individuals to know if their data is contained in the trust and electronically revoke access to their records.

## DATA TRUST ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

**Values**

The Data Trust, Trustee, Members, and Approved Users commit to the following key values in developing and maintaining the Data Trust-managed Data Resources, Approved Projects, and Allowable Uses.

Fairness

Understand, mitigate and communicate the presence of bias in both data practice and consumption.

Benefit

Set people before data and be responsible for maximizing social benefit and minimizing harm.

Openness

Practice humility and openness. Transparent practices, community engagement, and responsible communications are an integral part of data ethics.

Reliability

Ensure that every effort is made to glean a complete understanding of what is contained within data, where it came from, and how it was created. Extend this effort for future users of all data and derivative data.

**Data Trust Ethical Principles**

All data trust members, data stewards, trustee and affiliates, researchers and other approved users commit to:

1. Consider (if not collect) informed and purposeful consent of data subjects for all projects, and discard resulting data when that consent expires.
2. Make best effort to guarantee the security of data, subjects, and algorithms to prevent unauthorized access, policy violations, tampering, or other harm or actions outside the data subjects' consent.
3. Make best effort to protect anonymous data subjects, and any associated data, against any attempts to reverse-engineer, de-anonymize, or otherwise expose confidential information.
    *   This includes all intermediate results, working with individuals or companies to help them maintain the anonymity of all data and parties involved, and supporting the rights to explanation, recourse, and rectification for any data subjects impacted by data work.
4. Practice responsible transparency as the default where possible, throughout the entire data lifecycle.
    *   This includes providing enough context and documentation to enable other trained practitioners to understand and evaluate the use of data.
5. Foster diversity by making efforts to ensure inclusion of participants, representation of viewpoints and communities, and openness. The data community should be open to, welcoming of, and inclusive of people from diverse backgrounds.
    *   This can be achieved by: being conscious of, and owning the results of actions, regardless of intent; promoting the voices of marginalized groups; acknowledging and self-checking privilege; accepting checks of privilege by others in good faith, and using privilege to advocate for equity.
    *   The data community will not remain silent when witnessing others behaving in a manner that is not accessible, open, welcoming and inclusive.
6. Acknowledge and mitigate unfair bias throughout all aspects of data work.
    *   This includes but is not limited to providing details and methodologies around data collection, processing and storage, and actively working to identify and disclose bias in algorithms, training data, and test data.
7. Hold up datasets with clearly established provenance as the expected norm, rather than the exception.
    *   As a data collector, be responsible for recording provenance; as a data publisher, be responsible for propagating provenance; as a data scientist, be responsible for reviewing, considering, and declaring what is known about data provenance.
    *   Provenance is a living part of data work and can evolve with the project and all reasonable efforts should be made to understand and pass on provenance work.
8. Respect relevant tensions of all stakeholders as it relates to privacy and data ownership.
9. Take great care to communicate clearly, responsibly and accessibly.
    *   This includes: acknowledging and disclosing caveats and limitations to the process and outputs; considering and providing clear opportunities for feedback from all stakeholders; considering and discussing whether something should be done (not just if it can be done); and clearly communicating who may be impacted, and how they are impacted, in order to minimize any potential harm from data work.
10. Ensure that all data practitioners take responsibility for exercising ethical imagination in their work, including considering the implication of what came before and what may come after, and actively working to increase benefit and prevent harm to others.
